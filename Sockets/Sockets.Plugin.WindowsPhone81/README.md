# Sockets Plugin for Xamarin and Windows (PCL)
##### Looking for the code? 

As this library abstracts over .NET and WinRT, the actual wrappers live in __Sockets.Implementation.NET__ and __Sockets.Implementation.WinRT__ respectively. The files from these projects are linked in to each platform's project within Visual Studio. 

That's why there's nothing here :)
